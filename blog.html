          On this day, I created this page. I learned about CSS classes and how to make them work.
          As well, I learned about the myClass:hover usage, and how to make it so that
          if I hover over something, something else will be shown. I use this by making a class
          that I will use display: inline-block or display: none. when I hover.
          For this blog post, I'm going to modify the class: blogposts, and add the width to be 100%
          of the screen. This way, when I change the screen size (for example with mobile) it will
          automatically scale this post so that it's easy to see. I'll add this whole post into
          a div class now.
          <br>
          Nevermind, I just tried it and found out I don't need to. This is probably because
          I already have this inside of the class myPanel, and it, for some reason, already scales.
          I don't have anything in the class that would seem to make it do that, so maybe that is just
          part of how this works?
